# jf_layout_mod_ext
This extension (beta) slightly changes the layout of the forum to make responding to tickets easier by making the response editor stick to the right side. This extension is made only for Chrome and I can't guarantee functionalities on other browsers.

Features that I may add in the future:
1. Dark mode
2. Quick links clipboard
3. Ticket counter
4. Break tracker

# Installation
1. Download the zip file here
2. Extract the files on a folder
3. Open Chrome and enable Developer mode
4. Click on Load Unpacked and navigate to the folder
5. Reload the forum's landing page.
